##Introduction
Hi everyone, in this video, I will introduce our visualization system about data related to traffic accident to you. Our system contained four dimensions: Time&Date, Driver, Weather and Infrastructure. 

##Time&Date
Now, let's see the first dimension, Time&Date. In this section, we visualized the relationship between number of accidents and time&date. The first graph is the time line of Accident in U.S. 
The x-axis is the time of day, and the y-axis is the number of accidents in 4 years. In the selector on the left, you can select state for more detailed observation.

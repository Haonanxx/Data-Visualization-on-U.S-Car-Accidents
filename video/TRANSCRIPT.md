##Introduction
Hi everyone, in this video, I will introduce our visualization system about data related to traffic accident to you. Our system contained four dimensions: Time&Date, Driver, Weather and Infrastructure. 

##Time&Date
Now, let's see the first dimension, Time&Date. In this section, we visualized the relationship between number of accidents and time&date. The first graph is the time line of Accident in U.S. 
The x-axis is the time of day, and the y-axis is the number of accidents in 4 years. In the selector on the left, you can select state for more detailed observation.

##Weather
When analysing car accidents data, weather condition is necessary to be taken into consideration. This is a grouped bar chart that shows the relation among number of accidents, temperature and visibility. These data collected from 2016 to 2020 are presented in three different sorted order. Users can press each button to change the sorted order. To look into the details of weather conditions in each state, one can hover over a bar to see the value of each of data.

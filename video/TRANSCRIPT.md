##Introduction
Hi everyone, in this video, I will introduce our visualization system about data related to traffic accidents to you. Our system contained four dimensions: Time&Date, Driver, Weather, and Infrastructure. 

##Time&Date
Now, let's see the first dimension, Time&Date. In this section, we visualized the relationship between the number of accidents and time&date. The first graph is the timeline of the accidents in the U.S. 
The x-axis is the time of day, and the y-axis is the number of accidents in 4 years. In the selector on the left, you can select the state for more detailed observation.

##Weather
When analyzing car accident data, the weather condition is necessary to be taken into consideration. This is a grouped bar chart that shows the relationship between the number of accidents, temperature, and visibility. These data collected from 2016 to 2020 are presented in three different sorted order. Users can press each button to change the sorted order. To look into the details of weather conditions in each state, one can hover over a bar to see the value of each of the data.

##Severity&Infrastructure
Here is the Mapbox map that shows the severity of traffic accidents of the states and the counties in the US. Firstly, the pie chart shows the percentage of the appearance of the 10 different infrastructures when accidents happened in the US in the 5 years. When you hover over it, you can see the infrastructure percentage on the tooltip. If you click a state on the map, the pie chart will show the infrastructure data to the corresponding state. The legend of the infrastructure with 0 value will fade to gray. If you hover over the state, you are able to see the average severity level of the states on the tooltip in the top-left corner. There is also a button in the top-right corner. If you click it, the pie chart will reset to the infrastructure percentage of all states in the US. Also, you can zoom in to see the severity of counties, the tooltip will show up once you move your mouse and hover on a certain county. The bar chart shows the count of traffic accidents that happened near these 10 infrastructures in the 5 years with 4 different severities. You can use the slide bar to choose the severity to see the appearance of the infrastructures of different severity levels. The bars are sorted in descending order, so you are able to directly see what infrastructures cause a certain severity of traffic accidents more. Additionally, there are two buttons that allow you to choose all 10 or top 5 infrastructures to show on the chart.

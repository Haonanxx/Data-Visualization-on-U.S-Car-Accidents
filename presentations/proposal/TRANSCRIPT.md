## Slide 1
Our visualization project is gonna be based on a car accident dataset, which contains 3.5 million accident records. The data are collected from February 2016 to June 2020, covering 49 states of the USA.
## Slide 2
The visualization we are gonna realize would be useful for everyone who lives in the US. It can be used to study the car accident hotspot locations and casualty analysis and to extract the cause and effect of car accidents like environmental factors.
## Slide 3
By studying the cause and effect, people might be able to avoid or at least pay more attention when they are passing by the car accident hotspot locations and in adverse weather conditions that are related to pressure, visibility, wind direction, wind speed, or something like that.
## Slide 4
The thing is our dataset has too many features, and we are planning to do feature selection manually for the moment because we are focusing on the variables which we are interested in, so we might omit the interaction of features. If we try to use feature selection techniques extra, it might be time-consuming.
## Slide 5
The next two pictures shows what other visualizations have done on the same topic which is U.S. car accident. Bar charts and pie charts are the most common visualizations for demostrating simple statistics such like number of accidents by states and types of severity  
## Slide 6
More complex visulization involves displaying the data in one or more maps. And visualization can be interactive.
## Slide 7
In general, our plan is below. The dataset we will use come from kaggle. And based on our design, we will filter and reorganize the data using python script and SQL. Then we will use HTML, JavaScript, D3 library to develop the visualization interface.

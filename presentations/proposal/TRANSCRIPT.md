## Slide 1
Our visualization project is gonna be based on a car accident dataset, which contains 3.5 million accident records. The data are collected from February 2016 to June 2020, covering 49 states of the USA.
## Slide 2
The visualization we are gonna realize would be useful for everyone who lives in the US. It can be used to study the car accident hotspot locations and casualty analysis and to extract the cause and effect of car accidents like environmental factors.
## Slide 3
By studying the cause and effect, people might be able to avoid or at least pay more attention when they are passing by the car accident hotspot locations and in adverse weather conditions that are related to pressure, visibility, wind direction, wind speed, or something like that.
## Slide 4
The thing is our dataset has too many features, and we are planning to do feature selection manually for the moment because we are focusing on the variables which we are interested in, so we might omit the interaction of features. If we try to use feature selection techniques extra, it might be time-consuming.
## Slide 5
The next two pictures show what other visualizations have done on the same topic which is the U.S. car accident. Bar charts and pie charts are the most common visualizations for demonstrating simple statistics such as the number of accidents by states and types of severity.  
## Slide 6
More complex visualization involves displaying the data in one or more maps. And visualization can be interactive.
## Slide 7
I will describe our plan. In general, The dataset we will use comes from the Kaggle website. And based on our design, we will filter and reorganize the data using python script and SQL. Then we will use HTML, JavaScript, D3 library to develop the visualization interface. 
## Slide 8
In detail, our dataset contains many attributes, and we divided them into three classes. For data related to location, we will use maps to present them. And for time-related data, we plan to use line charts to represented the trending of data. For normal attributes, pie charts and bar charts will be suitable to represent the 
Comparison between values. At the same time, we will also establish interaction between different graphs, and implement filtering, sorting, and other functions to facilitate the use of users. 
## Slide 9
There are three students in our group, all of whom have rich experience in data analysis, processing, and front-end development. I believe that after learning about data visualization technology, we can complete this project with high quality. 
We will design our visualization plan together to make it more comprehensive, Then divide labor according to different types of diagrams. 
I will be responsible for the map graphï¼ŒQianqian Tang will mainly responsible for the time-related trend graphs and interactions. And Haonan Xu will be responsible for the links and comparison diagrams between accident-related variables.
## Slide 10
Here is the timeline we planned for our project. We will use one week to doing research on our dataset and the topic. Then we will use one week to design our visualization. 
After completing the visual analysis, we will spend a week to optimize it, as well as video recording and paper writing.
